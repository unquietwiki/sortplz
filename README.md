# sortplz

_sortplz_ is a simple file sorter. It takes targeted files, and moves them to subdirectories for further review.

**Usage:** sortplz -f _fromdir_ -t _todir_ -e _ext_

## TODO

- Sort by size
- Sort by name, not extension
- Colorful output
- Verbosity flag
- It'd be nice to have the files/extensions specified without a option.
